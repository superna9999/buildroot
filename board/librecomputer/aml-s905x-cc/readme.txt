Libre Computer AML-S905X-CC

Intro
=====
To be able to use AML-S905X-CC board with the images generated by
Buildroot, you have to prepare the SDCard or eMMC.

How to build it
===============

  $ make aml-s905-cc_defconfig

Then you can edit the build options using

  $ make menuconfig

Compile all and build rootfs image:

  $ make

Note: you will need to have access to the network, since Buildroot will
download the packages' sources.

Result of the build
-------------------

After building, you should obtain this tree:

    output/images/
    +-- Image
    +-- boot.vfat
    +-- meson-gxl-s905x-libretech-cc.dtb
    +-- rootfs.ext2
    +-- rootfs.ext4
    +-- rootfs.tar
    +-- sdcard.img
    `-- u-boot.bin

How to write the SD card or eMMC
================================

Once the build process is finished you will have an image called "sdcard.img"
in the output/images/ directory.

Copy the bootable "sdcard.img" onto an SD card or eMMC with "dd":

  $ sudo dd if=output/images/sdcard.img of=/dev/sdX

Insert the SDcard into your AML-S905X-CC, and power it up. Your new system
should come up now.
